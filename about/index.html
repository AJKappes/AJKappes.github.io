		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Marsh, Thomas L., <b>Technical Efficiency
of Food Intake Frequency on Childhood Stunting in Western Kenya</b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented">This paper evaluates how efficiently children in malnourished areas use food to promote height growth and then evaluates marginal effects of household characteristics on growth. Policy impacts are centered around the mitigation of stunting.</p>

        <p>Kappes, Alex J., Marsh, Thomas L. <b>Livestock Health Effects on Cost of Nutrient Consumption in Western Kenya</b>. Under review at Frontiers in Veterinary Sciences.</p>

		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Marsh, Thomas L. <b>Western Kenyan Household Macronutrient Demand</b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented"> This paper estimates demand for protein, lipid, and carbohydrate macronutrients in malnourished areas dependent on smallholder farming systems. The results of the paper better inform the construction of nutrition policy.</p>

		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Neibergs, J. Shannon. <b>Using Genetic Marker Selection
to Reduce Asymmetric Information in the U.S. Beef Supply Chain</b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented">This paper develops a theoretical asymmetric information environment consistent with current U.S. beef chain production environments - information on calf health is not directly observable by feedlots when purchasing calf lots. I derive an analytical solution that supports feedlots offering a price premium for calves produced using genetic marker selection, which acts to reveal calf health type and reduce information asymmetry. I empirically test the analytical solution using representative production data from a U.S. feedlot through Monte Carlo cost simulations, and find that offering price premiums for genetic marker selection calves is supported.</p>

		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Neibergs, J. Shannon. <b>Surveillance of Feedlot Bovine Respiratory Disease with Genetic Marker Selection Implications</b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented"> This paper extends an epidemiological SEIR model to allow for partial vital dynamics and simulates a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) outbreak in a representative feedlot. The simulation takes place in a Bayesian environment by including a stochastic BRD reduced susceptibility parameter in the SEIR model in order to evaluate cost impacts (savings) of genetic marker selection cattle during BRD outbreaks.</p>

		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Neibergs, J. Shannon. <b>Washington State Livestock Identification: Changes to Current Laws and the Future of Traceability</b>. Washington Agribusiness Status and Outlook. January 2020.</p>

		<p class="indented"> This paper details the implications of livestock traceability for managing and responding to livestock disease outbreaks, and also summarises recent changes to livestock tracebility laws in Washington State.</p>
