		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Neibergs, J. Shannon. <b>Using Genetic Marker Selection
to Reduce Asymmetric Information in the U.S. Beef Supply Chain</b>. Working paper.<em> Disertation Chapter 1</em>.</p>

		<p class="indented">This paper develops a theoretical asymmetric information environment consistent with current U.S. beef chain production environments - information on calf health is not directly observable by feedlots when purchasing calf lots. I derive an analytical solution that supports feedlots offering a price premium for calves produced using genetic marker selection, which acts to reveal calf health type and reduce information asymmetry. I empirically test the analytical solution using representative production data from a U.S. feedlot through Monte Carlo cost simulations, and find that offering price premiums for genetic marker selection calves is supported. Insights from this paper advance livestock production theory with results being directly applicable to industry in terms of production planning and livestock health.</p>
	

		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Marsh, Thomas L., <b>Technical Efficiency
of Food Intake Frequency on Childhood Stunting in Western Kenya</b>. Working paper.<em> Disertation Chapter 2</em>.</p>

		<p class="indented">This paper evaluates how efficiently children in malnourished areas use food to promote height growth and then evaluates marginal effects of household characteristics on growth. I use data envelopment analysis to estimate height growth efficiency from nutritional inputs and then specify a correlated heterogeneous fixed effects model to determine household characteristic impacts. Policy impacts are centered around the mitigation of stunting in order to promote health and prosperity.</p>
       

		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Marsh, Thomas L., <b>An Evaluation of Livestock Health Impacts on Production Inefficiency in Western Kenya</b>. Working paper.<em> Disertation Chapter 3</em>.</p>

		<p class="indented">This paper develops a two-stage modeling approach to determine the impacts of livestock health on household agriculutral production in malnourished areas. I use stochastic frontier analysis methods in the first stage to estimate production inefficiency and then specify a normal approximation to a binomial-logistic model in a Bayesian environment in the second stage to evaluate livestock health impacts. Lastly, I construct a fully-efficient counterfactual production outcome and estimate  household welfare loss due to livestock disease.</p>


		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Neibergs, J. Shannon. <b>Surveillance of Feedlot Bovine Respiratory Disease with Genetic Marker Selection Implications</b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented"> This paper extends an epidemiological SEIR model to allow for partial vital dynamics and simulates a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) outbreak in a representative feedlot. The simulation takes place in a Bayesian environment by including a stochastic BRD reduced susceptibility parameter in the SEIR model in order to evaluate cost impacts (savings) of genetic marker selection cattle during BRD outbreaks.</p>


		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Neibergs, J. Shannon. <b>Wealth and Environmental Incentives for Anaerobic Digester Technology in Dairies </b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented">This paper develops expected utility maximizing conditions for wealth derived from anaerobic digester production of biogas and crop nutrients using manure and waste inputs, subject to environmental and waste management constraints. I evaluate wealth maximizing conditions numerically by developing an anaerobic digester production model to provide information on optimal manure and waste inputs.</p>


		<p>Kappes, Alex J. <b>Expectation-Maximization Extension to Bayesian Regression Tree Treatment Effect Estimation</b>. Working Paper.</p>

		<p class="indented"> This paper removes conditioning on observable treatment and control group designations by employing an EM step in the Bayesian regression tree MH-Gibbs step for MCMC posterior sampling.</p>
