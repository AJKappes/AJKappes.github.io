		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Marsh, Thomas L., Tozer, Peter R., James, Allison E. <b>Technical Efficiency
of Food Intake Frequency on Childhood Stunting in Western Kenya</b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented">Nutrition intake plays a vital role in early childhood cognitive and physical health development, where nutrition deficiencies directly contribute to stunting. Growth potential reflects the difference in height-for-age between where an undernourished child is and where they would be in a more nourished and healthy environment. Stunting is used to describe the failure in reaching this potential and negatively affects the childâ€™s cognitive ability. This in turn affects education attainment and future earnings. Increased reproductive rates in less educated-low income areas further constrains the already limited means for individuals in these environments to achieve adequate living standards, which highlights the role stunting plays in one generation indirectly impoverishing the next. Increased rates of morbidity and mortality are also associated with stunting. The overall effects of stunting with the interplay of increased poverty, sickness, and death reduces societal well-being and national development. We develop a two-stage modeling approach using data envelopment analysis in the first stage to identify the relative efficiencies of food intake frequencies in promoting height growth for children in Western Kenya, followed by a fixed effect model in the second stage specified with correlated heterogeneous seasonality effects to determine the marginal effects of significant factors on child growth efficiencies. The findings of this paper provides information directly influencing development potential outcomes, which can be used to effect policy in both governmental and public health sectors to help prevent the cognitive, physical, and nationally destructive effects of child stunting in developing areas.</p>

		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Marsh, Thomas L. <b>Western Kenyan Household Macronutrient Demand</b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented">Malnourishment continues to plague developing regions even as energy availability steadily increases in developed regions. Associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality, intergenerational poverty transfer, and decreased national growth, the effects of malnourishment are considered debilitating. This paper takes food consumption data from western Kenya, an area with one of the highest rates of undernourishment, and breaks total household food consumption into protein, fat, and carbohydrate macronutrient consumption in order to estimate how market and household conditions affect macronutrient share demand. We find negative marginal own-shadow price effects of 0.17, 0.1, and 1.05 for protein, fat, and carbohydrate share demand, respectively. Substitution effects exist and are significant for each macronutrient. The largest substitutions take place when the shadow price for carbohydrates increases, resulting in unit increases of 0.55 and 0.67 for protein and fat share demand, respectively. Each macronutrient exhibits negative own-shadow price elasticities of share demand. Shadow price elasticity distributions result in mean values of protein and fat being unit elastic with carbohydrates being inelastic at absolute value 0.29. Carbohydrate shadow price elasticities are invariant across sample time while protein and fat shadow price elasticities experience variation into elastic and inelastic regions. Policy actions seeking to increase macronutrient demand in malnourished areas are directly informed by the empirical evidence provided from this paper.</p>

		<p>Kappes, Alex J., Neibergs, J. Shannon. <b>Using Genetic Marker Selection
to Reduce Asymmetric Information in the U.S. Beef Supply Chain</b>. Working paper.</p>

		<p class="indented">The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the theoretical mechanism that reduces information asymmetry between feedlots and cow-calf producers, who hold private information regarding calf health type. Bovine respiratory disease accounts for the largest cause of morbidity and mortality within the U.S. beef industry but calves produced using genetic marker selection technology have been shown to have increased respiratory disease resistance. With calf health type being characterized as genetic marker selected and non-genetic marker selected, theoretical results show that an optimal price schedule constructed by the feedlot results in price premiums being offered for a genetic marker selected calf. Theoretical results are then validated empirically using feedlot production data. Empirical results show a mean price premium of $11.36 offered per genetic marker selected calf based on original data, with Monte Carlo simulation providing a mean price premium of $15.72 being offered.</p>
