        		<h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
				<p>My name is Alex Kappes and I'm currently a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Ph.D. student in the School of Economic Sciences at Washington State University. I work at the intersection of producer/consumer theory, statistics, and data science. My research interests include agricultural and natural resource economics, global health and development, industrial organization, and econometrics with focus on machine and reinforcement learning as a subspace. (Secretly, I am extremely interested in somehow bridging what we know of quantum mechanics to consumer decision-making as a way to provide behavioral insight at the natural particle level; because we are just a bunch of atoms containing emotional electrons, among other things...).</p> 

				<p>I have a natural curiosity and deep passion in using numbers and expressions to tell stories that provide actionable insight when informing policy and/or decision-making. Improving all quality of life on the world stage is the goal; I just happen to leverage skills in Python and R to do it. As such, all project scripts can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/AJKappes">here</a> in hopes of providing examples that may help answer someone's statistical/mathematical programming question.</p>
				
				<p>The purpose of this site is to provide the usual "academic site" content like my curriculum vitae, as well as research and teaching information, and to also serve as a collection space for ideas and content I find interesting and noteworthy. Again, welcome!
