	<h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>

		<p>My name is Alex Kappes and I'm currently a 4<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Economic Sciences at Washington State University. My research interests include applied statistical learning, One Health and development, agricultural economics, industrial organization, as well as technology adoption, innovation, and sustainability. Within these areas I work on topics that contribute to the development of statistical modeling techniques when little information exists; to questions surrounding livestock disease effects on production and welfare; to production technology adoption and innovation in response to policy; and to development and markets in undernourished areas. </p> 

		<p>I am naturally curious about complex systems and have a passion for developing modeling approaches that provide actionable information for questions regarding these systems. My current work focuses on the development of variable selection techniques in a Bayesian environment for ordinal data, as well as expanding inference on treatment effects by allowing for a latent treatment designation in Bayesian regression trees. I also develop modeling techniques that provide information about the relationship between livestock health and production efficiency for the purpose of improving welfare. All project scripts can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/AJKappes">here</a>.</p>
				
		<p>The purpose of this site is to provide the usual "academic site" content like my curriculum vitae, as well as research and teaching information, and to also serve as a collection space for ideas and content I find interesting and noteworthy.</p>

		<p>Please feel free to <a href="mailto:alexander.kappes@wsu.edu">contact</a> me with any questions, and again, welcome!</p>
