	<h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>

		<p>My name is Alex Kappes and I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year Ph.D. student in the School of Economic Sciences at Washington State University. My research interests include agricultural and natural resource economics, global health and development, industrial organization, and applied statistical learning. Within these areas I work on questions surrounding livestock disease effects on production, demand, and One Health; agricultural production technology adoption and sustainability; as well as agricultural development and markets in undernourished areas. </p> 

		<p>I have a natural curiosity and passion for using numbers and expressions to tell stories that provide actionable insight when informing policy and/or decision-making. Improving all quality of life on the world stage is the goal; I just happen to leverage skills in R and Python to do it. As such, all project scripts can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/AJKappes">here</a> in hopes of providing examples that may help answer someone's statistical/mathematical programming question.</p>
				
		<p>The purpose of this site is to provide the usual "academic site" content like my curriculum vitae, as well as research and teaching information, and to also serve as a collection space for ideas and content I find interesting and noteworthy.</p>

		<p>Please feel free to <a href="mailto:alexander.kappes@wsu.edu">contact</a> me with any questions, and again, welcome!</p>
